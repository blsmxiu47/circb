# circb: An IRC client written in C

circb (or "C IRC blsmxiu") is nothing yet. It will implement the IRC Protocol, or at least some important subset of it.

For a more pleasant user experience and robust IRC, please see [TKTK](have not developed this yet), which is an IRC built in ??Go, ??Rust, ??Zig, not sure yet; guessing my prefs will change over time. circb was originally a way for me to get my feet wet (again) with the C langauge after job hunting and trying to appease the Javascript/frontend framework gods.

## While in development

Some things to note:
* When looking at the commit history for this repo there may be a lot of backtracking and trail and error over time. I enjoy learning (shamelessly) as I gradually make progress toward some eventual product that no one will ever use. Most likely some components will be developed only to be removed later entirely; all part of the process though ^^
* Will clean up the finished product if I ever get there, but until then I may chat with myself in comments, etc. All due apologies.
